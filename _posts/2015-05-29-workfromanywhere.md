This article contains key insights from Citrix and Wandera on the benefits and issues surrounding the use of technology to work anywhere.  The talk was aimed at CTOâ€™s, managers, and administrators of corporates and hosted by the British Computer Society.

<h1>Trends</h1>
<ul>
<li>Citrix representative made the observation that people have started to use smartphones as both work and personal devices whereby the phone is docked and attached to a laptop screen.</li>
<li>Smartphones feature a work splicing feature that allows private and personal data to remain separate from each other via the use of encryption and passwords similar to that used on Blackberry smartphones.</li>
<li>Companies are hiring more in-house app developers to build apps in much shorter time frames compared to outsourcing efforts offshore with up to three times the wait.</li>
<li>A Citrix software web platform that is device and app agnostic. You can have IOS, Android, Microsoft, and any other o/s dependent app deployed to employees in an almost seamless fashion. This should be available in 18 months.</li>
<li>A tool to redeploy legacy apps to the cloud in half the time</li>
<li>The user as end-point refers to the independence of being tied down to a single location as per the days of allocated desktops and network ports.</li>

<h1>Management of Devices</h1>
The downside to all this fast pace advancement is the cost of administering sometimes 100s of smartphone devices all with the potential to leak data from poorly designed apps and the risk of racking up high pay as you go data bills while employees stream YouTube while overseas.

Here, Citrix has a system called mobile network management (MNM), that allows administrators to perform actions in real-time as they occur e.g. suspicious uploading of data to an unidentified server. Similarly, Wandera offers security from man in the middle attacks and data leakage from 3rd party apps by monitoring data packets in real time as they pass from the phone up to the cloud based app or storage.

<h1>Why should we care?</h1>
The talk emphasized the need to protect against poorly programmed applications that leak data and malicious hackers that try and steal data. Over an enterprise of sometimes thousands of devices it can be hard to keep track of all security holes and thus centralised, automated real-time management of devices presents a real solution to mitigate this very real risk.
